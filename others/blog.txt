Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing technique where a business rewards its affiliates for promoting their products or services. The affiliates promote the business's products or services to potential customers, and if a sale is made, the affiliate earns a commission.

The process of affiliate marketing is straightforward. First, a business partners with an affiliate network or signs up for an affiliate program. The business then provides its affiliates with unique tracking links or coupon codes that they can use to promote the business's products or services.

When a customer clicks on one of these links and makes a purchase, the sale is tracked back to the affiliate, and the affiliate earns a commission on the sale. The commission can range from a few percent to several hundred percent, depending on the business and the product or service being sold.

One of the benefits of affiliate marketing is that it's a low-cost and low-risk way for businesses to promote their products or services. Instead of paying for advertising upfront, businesses pay their affiliates only when a sale is made. This means that businesses don't have to worry about spending money on ineffective advertising campaigns.
